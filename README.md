# Security_News_Webscraper
A simple webscraper which gets the news from your favourite sources and presents them on a index.html page for you viewing pleasure

This scraper isn't perfect... but it does work :D
*You just need to play around until you get the desired output*

Before using, in the same directory that you plan to run the script create two folders, **output** & **webpage** 
for some reason python freaks out and won't make the folders...

When setting up the scraper you will need to adjust the pages you want to scrape in scrape.py and then add an custom function for each webpage in
make_pretty.py this is due to those pages all having styled their links etc in different ways. But you can utilise my prepmade functions to help.

happy scraping!
